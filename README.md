# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, sourced from a research collaboration, contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. This dataset includes 284,807 transactions, among which 492 are fraudulent, representing only 0.172% of the transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, which is typical for fraud detection scenarios.

The dataset contains numerical features resulting from a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation. This means the original data has been transformed into a set of principal components, making it difficult to interpret the features directly. The dataset contains the following features:

- **Time**: The seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- **V1 to V28**: The principal components obtained with PCA. These features are anonymized to preserve privacy.
- **Amount**: The transaction amount, which can be used for example-dependent cost-sensitive learning.
- **Class**: The response variable, where:
  - `1` indicates a fraudulent transaction.
  - `0` indicates a non-fraudulent transaction.

This dataset is widely used to benchmark fraud detection algorithms due to its challenging nature and high level of anonymization and privacy.
